The United States\\n delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came \\n to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir\\'s soldiers, hungry and miserable, \\n their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation\\n was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed\\n by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns\\n before the eyes of Karabekir\\'s troops and the people. When it was hoped\\n that this operation would end, unfortunately since the beginning of \\n February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region\\n of Shuraghel, Akpazar, Zarshad, and Childir have increased. According\\n to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the\\n aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered,\\n many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women\\n have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who\\n were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the\\n mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity \\n and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the\\n Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order \\n to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities \\n committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims\\n be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives,\\n and honour of the Muslims be protected.\"\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n', 'From: hilmi-er@dsv.su.se (Hilmi Eren)\\nSubject: Re: ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES (Henrik)\\nLines: 95\\nNntp-Posting-Host: viktoria.dsv.su.se\\nReply-To: hilmi-er@dsv.su.se (Hilmi Eren)\\nOrganization: Dept. of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n|>The student of \"regional killings\" alias Davidian (not the Davidian religios sect) writes:\\n\\n\\n|>Greater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh, to the Black Sea, to the\\n|>Mediterranean, so if you use the term \"Greater Armenia\" use it with care.\\n\\n\\n\\tFinally you said what you dream about.

Other adapters control the\\n   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it\\n   in the high-impedence mode.\\n\\n - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate\\n   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines\\n   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't\\n   assert anything).

In general, if\\nyou have problems with sounds working when you play one per\\nchannel and then close the channel (with the related\\nslowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't\\nwork, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a\\nchannel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be\\nbecause you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with\\na sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to\\nthe channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds\\nhave this command at the start of them. You need to resedit\\nthe sound and remove that command, then when you create your\\nchannel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the\\nchannel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you\\nwant. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you\\nare going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.\\n\\nNow before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the\\nsound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses\\nit.

A\\nlower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible-\\ndistribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The\\nACLU\\'s Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court\\'s action\\nprotected the \"religious neutrality of our public schools.\" He also\\nsaid that schools must serve students of \"all faiths and none.\"\\nSchools were not to be a \"bazaar where rival religious groups\\ncompete for converts,\" according to Lynn.\\n\\nSeveral Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in\\nhospitals and hotels, are members of our church.

Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much\\ndifferently than had one applied them within the confines of\\ntheir original expression.\\n\\nI think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior \\nof the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit\\nfrom Merlinus X\\' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss\\' background, but surely\\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \\nfor many years.\\n\\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\\n\\n\\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\\n\\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \\nKellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition of\\nthe \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\\'m happily participating\\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\\nMass well enough for my tastes.\\n \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\\nlimited contact with other members.\\n\\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\\nand the preservation of individual vision.\\n\\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\\nto other posts in this thread.\\n\\n\\nInvoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.\\n\\nI am I!\\n\\nFrater (I) Nigris (DCLXVI) CCCXXXIII\\n'], 3: [\"From: cs902043@ariel.yorku.ca (SHAWN LUDDINGTON)\\nSubject: Re: 1993 NHL Draft\\nOrganization: York University, Toronto, Canada\\nLines: 51\\n\\nIn article <93109.134719IO91748@MAINE.MAINE.EDU> Jon Carr <IO91748@MAINE.MAINE.EDU> writes:\\n>When is the draft this year?

A\\nfairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We\\nall believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have\\nfirearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding\\nupon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to\\ndo it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with\\na philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting\\nthe many?

What\\'s up?\\n| \\n| This is a frequently asked question.  Every time it arises, it causes\\n| months of debate.  So let me see if I can answer you directly.\\n| Basically it\\'s because the Law was given to Moses as part of a\\n| specific covenanent with the Jews.  Most of us aren\\'t Jews, so we\\n| aren\\'t part of that covenant.  There was an argument early in\\n| Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to\\n| Gentiles who became Christians.  You can see the account of this\\n| debate in Acts 15.  The main question there was circumcision, but\\n| keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well.  The apostles\\n| concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians,\\n| and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us.\\n\\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\\n\\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\\n\\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\\n\\n4.  Israel stands for God\\'s people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ\\'s, then are ye\\nAbraham\\'s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\\nAbraham\\'s seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\\n\\n| \\n| While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us,\\n| because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews,\\n| we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected\\n| from the Jews and the things he expects from us.  After all, it\\'s the\\n| same God.  However there are several ways of dealing with this.\\n| \\n| These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments\\n| into \"moral\" and \"ceremonial\".  Ceremonial commandments apply only to\\n| the Jews.  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant.  These are\\n| thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision.  Moral laws apply to\\n| everyone.  Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except\\n| for the commandment about the Sabbath.  I believe most people who take\\n| this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on\\n| the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to\\n| worship regularly is part of the general moral law.  Thus Christians\\n| are free to choose the specific time we worship.\\n\\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\\n| \\n| A more radical approach (which is generally connected with John Calvin\\n| and the Reformed tradition) says that the Law as a whole is no longer\\n| binding.  Instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior\\n| should be guided solely by love.  Portions of the OT Law are still\\n| useful as guidance.  But they are not properly speaking legally\\n| binding on us.  In practice most people who take this position do not\\n| believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce.  While\\n| we may no longer be under Law, as sinners, it\\'s not safe for us to go\\n| into situations with no principles to guide us.  We\\'re too good at\\n| self-justification for that to be safe.  Thus Christians do have moral\\n| guidance, from things like Jesus\\' teachings, Paul\\'s advice, etc.\\n| These may not be precisely a Law, but they serve much the same\\n| function as, and have largely the same content as, the \"moral law\" in\\n| the previous analysis.  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed\\n| legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that\\n| given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important.\\n| \\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\\n\\n| In both analyses, the specific day is not an issue.  As a matter of\\n| tradition, we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ\\'s\\n| resurrection.  There\\'s some debate about what Acts shows about early\\n| Christian worship.  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish\\n| Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath, but\\n| that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then.\\n| Act 20:7 shows worship on the first day (Sunday), and I Cor 16:2 also\\n| implies gatherings on that day.\\n| \\n| There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to\\n| worship on the Sabbath (Saturday).  The best-known are the Seventh-Day\\n| Adventists and Jehovah\\'s Witnesses.  They argue that Act 20:7 is not a\\n| regular worship service, but a special meeting to see Paul off, and\\n| that I Cor 16:2 doesn\\'t explicitly say it\\'s a regular worship service.\\n\\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\\n| \\n| It\\'s clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul\\'s time.  See\\n| Rom 14:5.  Paul\\'s advice is that we should be very careful about\\n| judging each other on issues like this.  One person sees a specific\\n| day as mandated by God, while another does not.  He who observes that\\n| specific day does it in honor of the Lord.  He who believes his\\n| worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the\\n| Lord.  (Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue\\n| that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here.  Note however Col\\n| 2:16, which says something similar but briefer.  It explicitly\\n| mentions Sabbath.)\\n\\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\\nday of the moral law.\\n| \\n| There are some differences among Christians about use of the word\\n| \"Sabbath\".  Originally the term referred to the 7th Day, the Jewish\\n| day of worship.  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday, the\\n| day of Christian worship.  They do this largely so that they can apply\\n| the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering\\n| schemes) commandment to it.  Reformed tradition does not do this.  It\\n| distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated\\n| for Jews, and the Lord\\'s Day -- which is the free Christian worship.\\n| (The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1:10.)  There\\n| are also differences about laws regarding this day.  Many Christians\\n| support \"blue laws\", both in secular law and church law, setting aside\\n| that day and causing people to spend it in worship.  The more radical\\n| anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish\\n| Sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the\\n| Lord\\'s Day.\\n| \\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\\nmake false gods, to violate God\\'s name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\\n\\nDarius\\n\\n[It\\'s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\\nthink Paul\\'s comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\\n\\nHowever I\\'d like to be clear that I do not think there\\'s unambiguous\\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\\n\\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \\n\\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn\\'t tell us\\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius\\'\\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn\\'t say they gathered to\\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that\\'s just not explicit\\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul\\'s\\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can\\'t disprove it,\\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \\n\\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\\nworship was.\\n\\n--clh]\\n', 'From: frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O\\'Dwyer)\\nSubject: Re: Theism and Fanatism (was: Islamic Genocide)\\nOrganization: Siemens-Nixdorf AG\\nLines: 323\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: d012s658.ap.mchp.sni.de\\n\\nIn article <16BB8D25C.I3150101@dbstu1.rz.tu-bs.de> I3150101@dbstu1.rz.tu-bs.de (Benedikt Rosenau) writes:\\n#In article <1r3tqo$ook@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de>\\n#frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O\\'Dwyer) writes:\\n# \\n#>#>|>#>#Theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes.
